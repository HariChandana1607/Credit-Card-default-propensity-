# Credit-Card-default-propensity

## Credit Card default propensity prediction

### Objective 
Predict the probability of a customer defaulting payment for the credit card the subsequent month, based on past information. The past information is provided in the dataset. This probability will help the collections team to prioritise follow up with customers who have a high propensity of defaulting.

### Project instructions
1. Perform the required data pre-processing to treat for missing values and outliers
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to visualise the spread of each of the X variables and the
relationship between the various X variables and the Y variable
3. Identify any multi-collinearity and perform dimensionality reduction if required
4. Use the original X variables or derived variables (if any) & divide the given data into train and test
sets
5. Build a model to predict the default propensity of a customer
6. Evaluate the model based on model performance measures for classification and recommend the
most suitable model.
7. Come up with recommendations / actionable insights based on feature importance scores derived
from the model.
